# Travel-Europe
    Semestral project for NPRG031
    
# User's documentation
## Abstract
This program is used to find the shortest path between two cities and list information about the trip. The user has the option to choose the cities he / she wants to travel through. First, the user enters the parameters of the car he / she wants to travel. Then the user plans the route. At the end, the user will see a detailed route overview, that includes information about the length of the trip, the length of trips between cities, the total time spent on the trip, and the fuel and cost needed.

## Stages
### I. stage: Entering car parameters
When the application starts, the first window appears. The first window asks the user for four details of the car he is planning to     travel. The required parameters are the type of fuel, fuel consumption in liters per hundred kilometers, tank capacity and maximum        permitted speed.

### II. stage: Simulation
The user must select their start and destination city. It is also possible to add cities to go through on the path
from the starting city to the destination city. Once the user has selected both a starting and destination city, then he / she can       proceed to the "Simulation" button. After clicking the button the detailed route overview is shown in the log. If the user wants to      change car parameters, then the user can click on the "Car settings" button. If the user wants to calculate another trip, then the user  can click "Reset" button.

### Controls
#### Left mouse click
    Selects starting or destination city. Black circle appears.
    
#### Right mouse click
    Deselects any selected city.
    
#### Ctrl + right mouse click
    Allows you to add a city to your road, which means youâ€™re going through that city. Red circle appears.
    
## Example
  
The user wants to travel from Hamburg to Bratislava. Also he / she wants to travel through Berlin and Prague.

## Specification breakdown

### Architecture
The project can be split in a four high-level stages:
#### 1. Input
   The data for the map is stored in text file in specific format. The format must be strict because the map is parsed by regexes.
   The file can be segmented into three main parts, countries, cities and roads. Before every part there is a number indicated
   how many lines are there for each part. This is the reason why in this class is used the only global variable in this project.
   
#### 2. Map
   The data are stored in graph data structure which represents a map. Data are located in a text file in specific format, then they are    parsed using regexes. Map of Europe contains 21 european countries and over 400 cities overall.
#### 3. Car
   Vehicle with four parameters helps providing detailed information about user defined trip. Four parameters are fuel type, tank          capacity, consumption and maximum allowed speed.
#### 4. Shortest path
   Dijkstra's algorhitm is the main and the only algorhitm that is used in this project. It provides a calculation for finding the          shortest path from a starting city to a destination city.
#### 5. Visualization
   This stage provides graphic representation of a path, choosing the cities by clicking on the map, map itself.
   Cities on the map remembers their position in x,y coordinates, this helps in the terms of calculating distances that are then
   assigned to the roads between cities. The distance is calculated by using map scale and distance between coordinates. When user
   selects city then it is highlighted by circle.

### Main classes
#### 1. Input
Input has one class - ParseMap.cs. This class contains single method - ParseInput which returns Map.
Input file is parsed line by line using regexes _(System.Text.RegularExpressions)_.

Input regexes:
   ```csharp
   static readonly string Country = @"(?<CountryCode>[A-Z]*) (?<CountryName>[A-Za-z]*) (?<CurrencyCode>[A-Z]*)";
   static readonly string City = @"(?<Name>[A-Za-z]*) (?<CountryCode>[A-Z]*) (?<XCoord>\d+) (?<YCoord>\d+)";
   static readonly string Road = @"(?<StartCity>[A-Za-z]*) (?<DestinationCity>[A-Za-z]*) (?<MaxAllowedSpeed>\d+)";
   ```

Global integer variable server as an iterator through the input text file. Lines are matched and stored in a MatchCollection.
For each match in the MatchCollection function tries to match by a specific regex and gather the data, pass it to a constructor for whatever we are reading.

#### 2. Map
Map as a graph data structure is composed of three classes, City (node), Road (edge), Map (graph). 
Both City and Road inherits from IDrawable interface. This interface has one method - Draw returning nothing. It is simply used to implement drawing a city or road on the map.

##### 2.1 City
Simple class storing all needed and important information about a city and some basic actions. The city has a name, a country, a location (Point) and each city knows its neighbours - list of roads to/from the city.

##### 2.2 Road
Class representing an edge in the graph. Each road knows both cities at the ends of the road itself, maximum allowed speed, distance.
Distance is calculated in the Road constructor by map scale and distances between coordinates of both ends.

##### 2.3 Map
This class serves as a graph, it stores all countries and cities in dictionaries. So country or cities are easy accessible by their names.

### Data structures
Data structures implemented in this project are C# generics such as dictionaries and lists and own heap. Dictionaries are used for storing graph information and access time then is really fast. Lists are used in computation of finding the shortest path and other similar funcionalities. Heap is used as optimization for Dijkstra's algorhitm to store the cities sorted by distances from the starting city.

### Algorhitms
Dijkstra's algorhitm is an algorhitm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which in this particular example represent a map.
